# 2406-A5



I would download the github desktop client and clone this repository with it so that every time you make a change you can COMMIT AND PUSH to master branch so that it goes live on the website. The website will update AUTOMATICALLY so once you click push on the desktop client the changes will be live.


Import Info Below:

website url: https://www.tristanzon.herokuapp.com (you've both been added by email as collaborators lmk if it doesn't let you in)

heroku logs url: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/tristanzon/logs (this is where you look at console.log() from the live server.)

mongodb url: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/5ca1318f553855621cf5dcb7#clusters/detail/COMP2406A5 (both of you have been added as admins)


What should we sell??? Drugs? An OCS scrapper would be cool af but probs frowned upon XD. BTW this could be a legit store front and we have free hosting with heroku and mogodb
